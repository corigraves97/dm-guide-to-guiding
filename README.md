# The Dungeon Master's Guide to Guiding
## Background
Dungeons & Dragons is a tabletop roleplay game that has been around for years. Through different editions released and personal preferences it's a lot to track. With usually 4-6 players and usually months if not years of gameplay, you need organization. I love D&D and have been playing for years. I am currently about to DM a campaign and thought how nice it would be to take my binders full of information and multiple google docs and put it into one thing. There are websites like this already, including the one owned by D&D but there's too much going on for me personally and I wanted something straight forward. 

## Getting Started
Signup, and create a campaign! It's that simple. Enter your players (PC or NPC), encounters and relevant notes for easy access in game!
